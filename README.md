**Description of the Dataset** 

This dataset contains detailed energy consumption, emissions, and demographic data for counties across the United States. Each row represents a county and includes columns for state and county identifiers, geographic coordinates, population, employment, climate zone, and a wide range of energy metrics. These metrics cover electricity, natural gas, water, and transportation usage, as well as greenhouse gas emissions, expenditures, utility customers, and building information. The dataset is suitable for energy analysis, environmental impact studies, and regional comparisons of resource consumption and sustainability efforts.

**GOALS**

- Identify the locations with the highest emissions
- Total emissions per person
- Total emissions per county, plus analyze the percentage contributed by the top 10 counties with the highest emissions

**Tools**
 
Databricks is a unified analytics platform built on Apache Spark that allows organizations to process, analyze, and manage big data and AI workloads at scale in the cloud.


**Works**

I created a dashboard to analyze the counties with the highest emissions using SQL queries run in a Databricks notebook
